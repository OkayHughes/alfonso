This package is an implementation of the algorithm for nonsymmetric conic optimization which originally appeared in:

A. Skajaa and Y. Ye, A homogeneous interior-point algorithm for nonsymmetric convex conic optimization, *Mathematical Programming Ser. A*, 150 (2015), pp. 391-422. [https://doi.org/10.1007/s10107-014-0773-1](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10107-014-0773-1)

The implementation is based on the corrected analysis of the algorithm presented in:

D. Papp and S. Yıldız. On “A homogeneous interior-point algorithm for nonsymmetric convex conic optimization”. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00492](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00492)

The package also includes an implementation of the sum-of-squares optimization approach based on non-symmetric conic optimization and polynomial interpolants presented in:
